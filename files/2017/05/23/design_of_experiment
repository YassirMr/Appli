So the way to do it, with a full factorial design of experiments, is to look for main effect factors and interactions between factors.
We will take for each factor a two level scheme, high and low, and then run the full factorial experiment. 
We will specify a treshold from which we will say that the experiment failed (there is a t-way interaction for that configuration; if it 
happend for all the configurations) and the experiment is ok for values above the treshold. The treshold is the result of the experiment,
for our situation it is the value of rss. 
Then we will look for optimal configurations and reproducibility of results for a specific configuration. 
Run the experiment a couple of times to see if this factor is a main effect or there was some external noise at that time.
look for interactions between factors. 
Reproducibility: any two node interactions. And then we may look at the optional factors. 

Anova ?
why a fitting ? 


Steps:
design chosen: full factorial
run the tests and get the result for each experiment
enter the values in jmp (/graphically represent / represent) and get wich factors are influent
