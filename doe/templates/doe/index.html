<ul>
<li> R2lab is an anechoic chamber that offers the possibility to run tests into a controlled environment for reproducible research in wireless WiFi and 4G/5G networks. </li>
    <li> The lab is composed of 37 nodes, each one has 2 wireless cards that it can use for transmission. </li>
    </ul>
<!-- R2lab ? principles, description, characteristics of nodes.
then
what do we want ? why do we do this ?  -->

<h3 style="color:#004080;"> Methodology: </h3>
Our goal is to characterize the transmission inside of the lab and to understand the signal behavior (for predictability and reproducibility.) <br>
In order to characterize the transmission, we use the received signal strength metric. Namely when a node sends a packet to another,
the power of the signal received by the antenna is the metric used to say if the packet is usable or not. (if there is enough energy carried to decode the bits).<br> <br>
<ul> <li> A very good signal is above -40 dBm  </li>
<li> A good signal is -65 to -40 dBm  </li>
<li> Noise is below -85 dBm </li>  </ul>
<h4 style="color:#47476b;"> Reminder </h4>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig15.png" %}">
<h4 style="color:#47476b;"> How to achieve it ? </h4>
We will simply use the ping command to allow nodes to communicate and get the signal strength at the receiver node.
<h4 style="color:#47476b;"> What did we use ? (The technology behind) </h4> <!-- :(python, async, ssh nodes, ssh jobs..) -->
<b> We used : </b>
<ul>
<li> Python for programming the scripts that we run at the level of nodes.  </li>
<li> The apssh library to create ssh nodes which are instances holding information of an ssh connection and then instances of ssh jobs to be run at nodes.  </li>
    <li> Then the asynciojobs library executes the ssh jobs asynchronously at nodes and returns a result as soon as a node finishes processing. </li>   </ul>
<h4 style="color:#47476b;"> The script in a nutshell </h4>
<ul>
    <li> Create the ssh connections we will need.  </li>
    <li> Run a bash script in each node to create an ad-hoc network between nodes at the same frequency. </li>
    <li> Run tcpdump in each node. </li>
    <li> Run pings between nodes. </li>
    <li> Filter the pcap files and retrieve columns of interest corresponding to received signal strength and ip addresses of nodes. </li>   </ul>

<h3> 1.Assessing the antennas of the nodes</h3>
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Introduction: </h4>
Each node in the r2lab has 2 wireless cards it can choose for transmission. We decide to choose the atheros cards because they offer
the possibility to set a mask for antennas. The antenna mask controls how many antennas are used, whether it is for transmission or reception. Values for mask are [1,3,7] for respectively using [1,2,3] antennas.  <br>
We will assess antennas with a histogram of received signal strength values. <br> Note that when there is an ongoing transmission
while setting the mask 7, we monitor a fourth value that is the aggregation of signal strength by all antennas. <br>
For the experience
we take node 1 as receiver node and we get the rss values of each antenna separately and the value aggregated by all antennas:
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig1.png" %}">
<textarea  rows="11" cols="80">Mean value for ant=all is :-50.10583333333333
Standard deviation for ant=all is :8.760002405413891

Mean value for ant=0 is :-57.01888888888889
Standard deviation for ant=0 is :8.258323862375041

Mean value for ant=1 is :-59.74638888888889
Standard deviation for ant=1 is :9.144628760027942

Mean value for ant=2 is :-52.319722222222225
Standard deviation for ant=2 is :9.396421351043662
</textarea> <br>
We see that the histogram of the values when using all antennas is more skewed to the right, with a higher mean than the histogram
of the other antennas, wich shows that we receive better when we use all the antennas. <br>
When using all the antennas we end up with a better signal, the reason behind it is the use of
a technique called maximal ratio combining and it consists on extracting the maximum energy of bits at each antenna
and aggregate the best symbol energies to get the highest value for the received signal strength. <br> <br>

Note that these values are for reception, we kept sending with all antennas. There is also a noticeable difference between sending with
one anttena and sending with all of them. (2-4 dB of difference)

<h3> 2.How much does transmission power impact received power ? </h3>
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Context: </h4>
In this experience we modify the transmission power and monitor the received power at the level of the receiver, because more stability is offered when using all antennas, we go for that choice.
<br>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig2.png" %}"> <br>
The perfect case scenario is in each time we increase transmission power by 1dB, the received power should also increase by 1dB. The figure above is closely following this pattern.
<h3> 3. Model fit of the lab transmission: </h3>
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Introduction: </h4>
We find many transmission models that predict the received signal strength depending on factors, for instance if the transmission is indoor or outdoor,
depending on the frequency of the transmission, on the distance between the two equipments, the number, thickness and material of the obstacles etc.
Our purpose here is the evaluate the models with a real transmission inside the lab. <br>
The models chosen are the following: <br>
<ul>
<li> <b style="color:#6C2333;"> The Telecoms equation:</b> <img src="{% static "doe/images/fig17.png" %}">  </li>
     <br> Where: <ul> <li>  Gt = Gain of transmission antenna.</li>
 <li>  Gr = Gain of receiving antenna.</li>
 <li>  λ = wavelength </li>
  <li>  R = distance between the two antennas.</li>
</ul>
<li> <b style="color:#6C2333;"> The Two-Rays Ground Reflected Model:</b> <img src="{% static "doe/images/fig18.png" %}"> </li> <br>
<li> <b style="color:#6C2333;"> The Hata Model:</b> <img src="{% static "doe/images/fig19.png" %}"> <br> With <img src="{% static "doe/images/fig20.png" %}"> </li>
     <br> Where: <ul> <li>  hB = Height of the emitting antenna</li>
 <li>  hM = Height of the receiving antenna.</li>
 <li> CH = Antenna height correction factor.</li>
</ul>
<li> <b style="color:#6C2333;"> The log-distance path loss model:</b> <img src="{% static "doe/images/fig21.png" %}"> </li>
    <br> Where: <ul> <li>  PL0 is the path loss at the reference distance d0</li>
 <li>  γ is the path loss exponent, taken equal to 2.</li>
 <li> Xg is a normal (or Gaussian) random variable with zero mean, reflecting the attenuation (in decibel) caused by flat fading, taken equal to 0.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Result: </h4>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig3.png" %}">
<textarea  rows="2" cols="80">Mean square error r2lab/log: 15.634757993982516
Mean square error r2lab/hata: 92.28024469715685</textarea>
<br>
The model representing the best the transmission inside r2lab is the logarithmic model, indeed this model was made for indoor communication
where the signal fades rapidly with distance.

<h3> 4.The Rssi is very hard to predict. Calibration, a first answer ? </h3>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig4.png" %}">
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Introduction: </h4>
We only want to characterize the transmission channel, this is why we run experiments in an anechoic chamber to discard the maximum interference
possible, but we still have fluctuations of signal. In a matter of fact Wireless cards tend to run unseen algorithms to make the signal
better when they sense that the noise level is higher than a threshold. We recall that the noise is a parasite signal that wireless
cards continuously measure in every channel among the possible ones to use, it is inherent to the card, the noise depends on the state
of the cards, on the state of the antennas etc. <br>
To investigate these changes we run the same experiment but this time by getting the noise level before running the pings and importantly by turning off all the
other wireless nodes. <br>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig5.png" %}">

<h5> What do we see ? </h5>
The noise signal increases at some moments, the card then senses it and tries to adjust itself for a better reception which causes signal strength to increase at these times.

<h3> 5. Heatmaps:</h3>
<h4 style="color:#004d99;"> Introduction </h4>
Heatmaps are a useful way of characterizing the transmission inside the lab, we pick a node sender and display the power received by
all the other nodes. Heatmaps are also a way to look for changes and spot if some nodes do not receive as they should.
We will use heatmaps to denote changes between the two transmission bands in wifi, namely 2ghz and 5ghz.
I should say that it is not permitted to use the 5ghz band is France. The cards come with regulations depending on where they will
be sold. We had to work around the ath9k driver of the atheros cards, patch it so that we don't allow it to read the regulation domain imposed by a third party driver "ath" then recompile the linux wireless driver to access that band. <br> <br>
In theory the transmission in 5ghz is more prone to signal degradation with distance. And also the signal is more attenuated when it meets an obstacle due to the behavior of electromagnetic waves with obstacles of the same size as the wave.
Waves that have the same length of obstacles will get attenuated more than if the wavelength is longer than the
obstacles it sees. <br>
We note the corresponding matching between wavelengths to frequencies: <br>
 2ghz : 12.5 cm <br>
 5ghz : 6 cm  <br>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig6.png" %}">
<br>


The result doesn't show a particular logic in which the signal is all time better.
In matter of fact if one wants to see the difference in this context, the distance should be increased more than what the lab offers.
The lab highest distance between two nodes is 12.14 meters, while wifi's range is up to 100m. Thus we don't observe the so called difference between
2ghz and 5ghz.
Instead we see the following pattern when node 1 is sender:
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig13.png" %}">
<br>
What could cause such a pattern is the disposition of nodes inside the room, in fact each node is covered by a metallic cache
and we know that conductors are perfect reflectors of the electromagnetic waves. thus the transmission inside is subject to reflexions and
depending on the wavelength we could get a better signal in some areas in 2ghz and in other areas for 5ghz. <br>
It is hard to predict what will happen with reflexions. The reflexion is proven by the following: <br>
Node 25 and node 23 don't see each other, they should not be able to communication but an experiment done to assess the impact of line of sight gave the following: <br>
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig14.png" %}"> <textarea  rows="3" cols="80">
Node sender                Node receiver           LOS                    Rss
25			    14			    Yes			-43.71
25			    23			    No			-56.85
</textarea> <br>
The difference between LOS and NLOS communication is of 13 dB, which is huge but we still get a signal.

<h3> 6.Do other nodes cause interference ? </h3>
<b> The answer is yes </b> if the nodes are sharing the same frequency canal, or adjacent canals. But the question is how much interference do they cause.
To answer this question we modified the script used to get the rssi. We turned down wireless
interfaces of nodes not participating in the communication before transmitting between two nodes. The goal was to leave only the nodes communicating with
interfaces that are up. <br>
We display a heatmap of the same the frequency, before and after changing the script.
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig8.png" %}"> <br>
There is a small difference, we slightly receive a better signal when we turn off the wireless interfaces of other nodes.
The reason why we don't see a major change is that we don't run our ping experiment simultaneously, instead we sequentially run the pings,
which causes signal not to melt with another one. The difference noticed is that nodes stop sending control packets when turning off their wireless interfaces.

We noneless need to say that sometimes interference can be positive, the received
signal is then the sum of two interference signals that give a signal of higher amplitude, depending on the phase of signals at the time of
interference. <br> <br> So does that mean that turning off wireless interfaces causes results to be more predictive ? <br>
To answer that we display consecutive heatmaps of the same frequency both with the logic of turning off wireless interfaces before
transmission.
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig9.png" %}">
The highest fluctuation is an absolute value of 2.6 dB. <br>
When we do the same experience without turning off wireless interfaces:
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig10.png" %}"> <br>
We would expect to have more fluctuation in the signal but we notice that fluctuations are of the same order, because in fact there is a stability in the noise as well. <br>
When we look at the noise at the moment of transmission, when turning off wireless interfaces of other nodes we expect to have less noise in the room.

But when we display a noise heatmap between not turning down interfaces and doing it;
<img src="{% static "doe/images/fig11.png" %}">
We notice that the noise is fairly the same in the two heatmaps. <br>

Another element worth mentioning is that there is more noise in 2ghz than in 5ghz, we can see it from the noise figure in 5ghz below:

<h3> 7. oK so what are the influent factors on the rssi ? </h3>


<h4> Introduction: </h4>
This experiment's objective is to denote what are the influent factors on the received signal, for this purpose
we have considered the following variables:

<ul>
    <li> Transmission Power </li>
    <li> Physical rate </li>
    <li> Distance </li>
    <li> Frequency </li>
</ul>
Every one of the above factors have been taken in a high and low value. For example, Tranmission power: [5,14] dBm. <br>
<h5> Experience </h5>
Nodes involved in the experiment: Sender 4   Receivers  9,36.  <br>

</textarea> <br>
From this experiment we notice that distance and transmission power are influent factors, by changing them the received signal strength highly changes.
The rate on the other hand doesn't highly impact the rss and so as the frequency (for this distance experienced).

<h4> What about future work ? </h4>
We would like to find a consistent propagation model that signal inside the lab follows. <br>
To do so, the first step is to construct a set of nodes depending on whether a node's antenna is on line of sight or not then
make a fitting of power received by antennas for each category. The model should consider all the influent factors and give reproducible results.
